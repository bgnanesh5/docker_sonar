Lookup Relationship:
====================
type:
----
- Self Relationship
-------------------
A - A is related to A is self relationship
student - student refered by another student

- Hierarchial relationship:
---------------------------
- Self relationship on user object

Many to Many relationship:
--------------------------
student table\
	      Student in Group Table
Groups table/

- When we create many to many relationship we have to create new table with two foreign keys it referes to two tables

- Junction Object - If your create many to many relationship the third table we create which is called Juntion object

conflicts on owner:
-------------------
- Primary master relationship
- Secondary master relationship

- security field inherited from both the objects
- We can create only 2 master-detail relationship fields on single object
- In salesforce we can create max 40 relationship field

	lookup = Total - Master Detail
		  (40)


Student
Faculty
Course
Batch
Rating

- In Master-Detail Relationship - if parent is having only Ready only permission eventhough we can edit Child
				- if parent is having both Read & Write permissions even we can edit Child
				- Automatically Owner field will get deleted


Validation Rules:
=================
- To check the whether the entered data valid or not

Validation Rule:
  1. Formula - Boolean(T/F) - it is false -> Record gets saved in database
  2. Error
				
Registration fee < 5000

Write a program if a student registered any other course then salesforce admin, sd, Bigdata then the regfee is should be 
atleast 5000 or more, else it can be anything


return false ===== Save
return true ===== Error

RegFees = 6000
CourseOpted == 'Salesforce Admin'

boolean valCheck(RegFees, CourseOpted)
{
	if (CourseOpted == 'Salesforce Admin' || CourseOpted == 'Salesforce Developer' || CourseOpted == 'Big Data'
	 {
		return false;
	 }
        else
	 {
		if(RegFees < 5000)
		{
			return true;
		}
		else
		{
			return false;
		}

	}

}

- student should atleast 12 yrs inorder to get enroll
reg date should not be grater than today as well as
